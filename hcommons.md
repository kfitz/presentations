Note: Which was developed by the MLA. This is usually the point at which I explain that the tanModern Language Association, which was founded in 1883 and is currently the largest scholarly society in the humanities and, as such, is a quite significant scholarly publisher. We publish multiple journals, including PMLA, the flagship journal in our fields. We also publish several book series, focused on both professional and pedagogical issues. Publishing has long been a core component of the associationâ€™s business model and its value proposition for members.
